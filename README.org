libCat is a non-POSIX compliant C++23 runtime. It has no pthreads nor =malloc()=, and by extension no exceptions. It has type-safe arithmetic, SIMD, fast syscalls, interfaces (also known as facades), and value-based error-handling, among many other features.

* Building
libCat requires a development version of GCC 13. Building appears to fail using =make=, and is only tested using =ninja=.
